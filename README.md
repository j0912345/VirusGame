# Jo's mod of virus game!
I might add stuff here if I feel like it. it's fun to add more stuff to this project.
here's a misc. and potentially incomplete list of changes/stuff added:
-  viruses now have a 10% chance to mutate every time they are created from a cell.
-  changed default ugo to write 3 + kamikaze genome.
- buffed energy gain from digest wall (energyGain * 0.2 -> energyGain * 0.4)
- added new 'ugo' codon operand.
- writing ugos now must be done via "write ugo" instead of just being what happens with any outwards write, no matter the operand codon.
- added "digest ugo".
  - this allows for basic immune system stuff to be created until I actually create some kind of immune system system.
- added flag to allow inserting code right in front of the interpreter's current position.
-  and potentially more in future!
