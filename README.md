# Jo's mod of virus game!
I might add stuff here if I feel like it. it's fun to add more stuff to this project.
here's a misc. and potentially incomplete list of changes/stuff added:
-  viruses now have a 10% chance to mutate every time they are created from a cell.
-  changed default ugo to write 3 + kamikaze genome.
-  and potentially more in future!
