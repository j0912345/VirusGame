- extra varible that controls how used energy scales with the amount of food particles in the enviorment and the world size
- some kind of immune system particle
- some kind of particle that will give energy to cells that have ran out of energy, giving them a second chance instead of just being a fully sealed fate of death
- some kind of cell reproduction system
- add option to paste in ugo strings instead of having to manually program long ugos every time.
- add keybind to reset the simuation so the program doesn't need to be restarted. this wouldn't clear the current custom ugo genome.
- save statistics to some kind of log file. either compress or delete old logs
- in the create ugo menu add a button to toggle what team the ugo is on. mainly just a nice convenience

BUGS:
- if you manually edit a cell and it dies then viruses in cells can go negative
